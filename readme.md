## concurency z parallelism


Concurency = one task at time but multiple functions. Go channels always run asynchronously. To opn new thread we use go routines 

Paralelism =  multiple tasks at time (one therad of execution)


## ways of concurency implementation

 - Processor threads
 - Events
 - Callback promises
 - CSP (erlang, Go  channels and actors)
